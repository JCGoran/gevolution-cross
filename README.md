# TODO list

- [ ] find a good fit for the correlation coefficient for all redshift pairs
- [ ] check dependence of fit on initial seed (*optional, probably minimal as we're interested mostly in small scales*)
- [ ] check dependence of fit on cosmological parameters
- [ ] check if correlation coefficient can be computed with COFFE in reasonable time (*optional*)
- [ ] verify that cutoff k ~ 7 h/Mpc is sufficient (baryonic physics?)
- [ ] check for convergence w.r.t. different simulation parameters
- [ ] check CLASS HALOFIT and HMCode for accuracy and speed as comparison for nonlinear power spectra
